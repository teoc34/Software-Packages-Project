Poverty's influence on education Poverty's Influence on Education: A Python and SAS Analysis Overview This repository hosts a multidisciplinary project aimed at unveiling the intricate relationship between poverty and educational outcomes. 
Intended for software developers, educators, and students alike, this project leverages the robust analytical capabilities of Python and SAS to explore, analyze, and visualize how socioeconomic factors influence educational access and success.
Objectives To identify and illustrate the various ways poverty impacts education. 
To provide a comprehensive analytical toolset for researchers and educators interested in socioeconomic studies. 
To foster an educational community that collaborates to find actionable solutions and interventions. 
Features The project combines Python's flexibility with SAS's statistical strength to offer a multifaceted approach to data analysis. 
Key features include:
Creation of SAS datasets from external files for robust data handling. 
Custom user-defined formats in SAS for tailored dataset categorization. 
Iterative and conditional data processing in both Python and SAS to uncover patterns and trends. 
Advanced data manipulation techniques, such as subsets, array processing, and combining datasets using specific SAS and SQL procedures. 
Comprehensive reporting and visualization capabilities, including SAS report procedures and Python's matplotlib library. 
Statistical analysis using SAS's statistical procedures and Python's scikit-learn and statsmodels packages. 
Python Features Utilization of lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples along with their specific methods for efficient data structuring and manipulation. 
Function definition and usage for modular coding. Conditional and repetitive structures for data processing logic. 
Data manipulation and analysis using pandas, including file importation, loc/iloc data accessing, and dealing with missing values. 
Advanced data processing with merge/join operations and group functions. 
Graphical data representation using the matplotlib package and statistical analysis through scikit-learn and statsmodels packages. 
SAS Features Data set creation from external files, applying user-defined formats, and conducting iterative and conditional processing. 
Data subsets creation, utilization of SAS functions, and data sets merging with specific SAS and SQL procedures. 
Utilization of arrays, report and statistical procedures, and generation of insightful graphs to illustrate educational outcomes influenced by poverty.
